Monkey 0:
  Starting items: 79, 98; 54, 65, 75, 74
  Operation: new = old * 19
  Test: divisible by 23
    If true: throw to monkey 2
    If false: throw to monkey 3 #always throws to monkey3 with starting values

Monkey 1:
  Starting items: 54, 65, 75, 74
  Operation: new = old + 6
  Test: divisible by 19
    If true: throw to monkey 2
    If false: throw to monkey 0 #always throws to monkey0 at start

Monkey 2:
  Starting items: 79, 60, 97
  Operation: new = old * old
  Test: divisible by 13
    If true: throw to monkey 1
    If false: throw to monkey 3 # always throws to monkey 3

Monkey 3:
  Starting items: 74;  79, 98
  Operation: new = old + 3
  Test: divisible by 17
    If true: throw to monkey 0
    If false: throw to monkey 1



x * 19 and operation never divisible by 23
x + 6 and operation never divisible by 19
x * x and operation never divisible by 13


notice: monkey2 rarely gets anything, others rougly equal -> most likely because random numbers are rarely divisibly by 23

maybe try other divisors -> no luck up to 10000
maybe try modulo -> no luck up to 10000
maybe try subtraction
